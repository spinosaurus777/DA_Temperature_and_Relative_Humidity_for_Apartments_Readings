# DA_Temperature_and_Relative_Humidity_for_Apartment_Readings
# Description
Reads, cleans and process relative humidity and temperature data for a set of apartments, 
and matches the data with data from goverment agencies. Finally, produces graphs for 
each of them as well as a graph containing all the data. 

This repository does not include the databases nor the sources of them. While I would like 
to share the complete project, it involves sensible data that I am
not allowed to share. However, with the adequate permission, I have included two results 
graphs as an example.
